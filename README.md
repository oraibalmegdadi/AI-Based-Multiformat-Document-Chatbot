# Repository Description

This repository contains an implementation of an offline Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) model for a Document Chatbot, providing Conversational AI capabilities for multiformat PDFs and TXTs. The model combines cutting-edge technologies and tools to provide a robust, interactive, and efficient document querying system. Users can upload multiple document formats, including PDFs, and text files, and interact with the documents through a conversational AI interface. Moreover, The application allow to save the conversation and  has the ability to load it later and continue the conversation without a need to upload the documents again. Additionally, the model extracts text chunks and generates embeddings for each document, which can be useful for further analysis or processing tasks.
## Key Technologies and Tools

- **[Ollama](https://ollama.com/)**: Used for large language models and embeddings.
- **[Langchain](https://www.langchain.com/)**: Provides the framework for building applications with language models.
- **[Mistral](https://mistral.ai/)**: A state-of-the-art language model used for generating responses.
- **[FAISS](https://ai.meta.com/tools/faiss/)**: A library for efficient similarity search and clustering of dense vectors.
- **[Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/)**: An open-source app framework for Machine Learning and Data Science teams to create interactive web applications.


## Main Model Description

This model utilizes the Ollama software tool to run large language models (LLMs) locally on a computer, enabling offline language processing tasks. Ollama provides access to a diverse set of pre-trained LLM models. Langchain complements Ollama by acting as a framework, allowing developers to integrate these locally-run LLMs into applications. This makes the LLMs easier to use and build upon. Langchain goes a step further by enabling the development of RAG systems, which use various tools to process information, resulting in more refined and informative responses from the language model.


## Extra Features

- **Multi-format Document Support:** Upload and process PDFs and TXTs files.
- **Text Chunking:** Efficiently splits large texts into manageable chunks for better processing.
- **Vector Store Creation:** Uses FAISS to create a vector store of document embeddings.
- **Conversational Interface:** Enables users to interact with the documents through natural language queries.
- **Memory Buffer:** Maintains context across conversations for a seamless user experience.
